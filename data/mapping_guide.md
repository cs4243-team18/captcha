# Similar char mapping rules (pls add on if yall spot anything new lel thanks)

- 1, i, I, l, L: 1 got the thing on top, i must have the dot. For I, if got the line on top and below is capital letter i which we classify as lowercase i, else is lowercase l, uppercase L must have the protrusion at bottom which we also classify as lowercase l

- 0, o, O: skinny oval means digit, fat oval / almost round means o

- 0 with diagonal lines incide the oval will be counted as 0 instead of 8

# Dirty images (remove from dataset)

- Missing characters or random icons
- Uses roman numerals or greek alphabets
- Too much noise / character overlap
