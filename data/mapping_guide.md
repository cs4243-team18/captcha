# Similar char mapping rules (pls add on if yall spot anything new lel thanks)

- 1, i, I, l, L:
  - digit 1 must have the protrusion at top-left
  - letter i must have the dot on top
  - For capital i, i.e. I, must have the horizontal line at the top and bottom
  - EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS A LINE is lowercase l

- 0, o: only basically perfectly round circles (height = diameter) will be the letter 'o', anything that looks like an oval / not a perfect circle (height >> diameter) must be labeled as the digit '0'

- 0 with diagonal lines inside the oval will be counted as 0 instead of 8

# Dirty images (remove from dataset)

- Missing characters or random icons
- Uses roman numerals or greek alphabets
- Too much noise / character overlap
